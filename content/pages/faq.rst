Will this course be online?
   **Update: The 2022 course will be in person in Delft!**
   We hope not! We have all the intentions to have the course in person in
   Delft after two years of it being online. The course is meant to be
   experienced in person with extensive practicals and site visits. If travel
   to and education activities in the Netherlands is permitted, the course will
   be in person. The course will be online if not. We will announce on **May 1,
   2022** if the course has to be reverted to online. **Do not purchase travel
   and accomodation before this announcement.**
Are there fixed lessons each day from 9:00 to 17:00?
   No, there will be about 2 hours of in-class lectures and a some days will
   have up to an extra 2 hours of activities. We'll try to plan each lecture
   for a mid-morning start time, but some lecturers may need to give the
   lectures earlier or later in the day. For early planning purposes **reserve
   8:00-22:00 for each day of the course in your personal agenda**. If the
   course is in person there will also be travel to sites around the
   Netherlands on some days, taking much of the day. The `schedule
   <{filename}/pages/schedul.rst>`_ will be updated as we finalize the lessons.
How many hours of work is required over the two weeks?
   The course is worth 3 ECs, so expect a full time work load for the two
   weeks.
Do we work in teams?
   Yes, you will be in a multidisciplinary international team and will work
   with that team for each assignment.
How will the course be delivered given if the course is online?
   The lectures, workshops, discussions, etc. will be delivered online via a
   video chat service. You will work with your team remotely, as some members
   will be in different locations. The practical aspects of the assignments
   will be performed at home using simple engineering tools and methods. For
   team members that happen to be in the same location, they may work together
   in person as long as they are following the local coronavirus regulations.
Can I register myself?
   Each University will have a different way to register. See the information
   provided on the `main page <{filename}/pages/index.rst#registration>`_ or
   contact the coordinator at your University.
Do you arrange our travel and accomodation?
   No, we do not. But we do provide some tips for you on the `travel &
   accomodation <{filename}/pages/travel.rst>`_ page.
