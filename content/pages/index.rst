*Special Topics in Sports Engineering* is an inter-university course for Master
students in Mechanical Engineering, Movement Sciences, Sport Sciences, and
other related MSc programs. The course is organized as a two-week intensive
course and comprises lectures, demonstrations, practicals, hands-on research,
and a final field test. The course will be taught by staff from the six
participating universities. Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, this
year's course will again be online.

The course is organised around a basic theme relevant for sports engineering
and this year's theme will be "Maximizing cycling performance". During the
course students will work out what aspects determine cycling performance, and
collect data (through experiments or literature research) that are needed to
develop and feed a simulation program for the estimation of the optimal
bicycle–rider combination and the maximal performance humanly possible. The
course's final activity will be a test ride to quantify the differences between
actual performance and predicted performance.

In this course, students will have to answer the question:

   Given a particular bike, what will be your own predicted time over a given
   distance and track and how well does this match reality?

The prediction should be based on a power-based simulation model of cycling and
the relevant bicycle and rider dependent parameters, which have to be collected
experimentally. Answering this question will require insight in relevant
parameters, but also collecting these parameters, for each individual student
with his or her individual bike. The bike in question can be chosen freely and
might therefore be a top-end racing bike as well as your grandmother's shopping
bike.

Study Goals
===========

After following this course, students should understand the complexity of
maximizing sports performance and the importance of the inclusion of
material–athlete interaction. More specifically, students should be:

- Familiar with the Power Equation concept and be able to apply this to
  cycling;
- have knowledge of methodological aspects of sports research, in particular
  error propagation, man–machine interaction (closed loop complexity),
  measurement techniques, internal and external validity.
- have insight in the organizational and psychological complexities of sports
  innovation.
- Able to measure key parameters needed for power equations, related to their
  own field and have experience in the measurement of key parameters in
  adjacent fields;
- able to provide a cycling performance simulation program with the parameters
  necessary to evaluate performance on a realistic level;
- able to collect and present to fellow group members, data on parameters for
  such a simulation program.
- present research findings through an individual portfolio, and a group
  presentation/poster/brief oral.

Dates
=====

The course will occur over the two weeks of **May 31, 2021 to June 11, 2021**
with activities scheduled throughout the day from Monday to Friday each week.

**Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, the course will be held
virtually.**

Credits
=======

The course is designed as a 3 EC course, but packed into two weeks. Some of the
participating universities will award you the credits; ask your coordinator for
more information.

Registration
============

Students will register with the coordinator at their home university. There are
a guaranteed number of slots for students from each of the participating
universities. Excess students will be placed on a waiting list. Slots will be
filled on a first come, first serve basis.

**Registration deadline is April 16, 2021.**

Reach out to your university's coordinator to find out how to register:

Communication
=============

We will make use of the `Microsoft Teams`_ platform for all course
communication. We will use a "Team" named "Sports Engineering 2021" for
announcements, lectures, office hours, the social, and channels will also be
available for your group to use for group work. Hopefully, all communication
about the class will stay within the team to simplify working across multiple
universities and countries. Steps to getting access to the Sports Engineering
2021 team:

- Download and install the Microsoft Teams software (free for use on all major
  desktop platforms).
- If you are TU Delft student or employee, open Teams and log in with your TU
  Delft netid. Once logged in, you should see the "Sports Engineering 2021"
  team under "Teams" in the MS Teams application. You are done.
- If you are not with TU Delft, create a free `Microsoft account`_ then check
  the email you registered with for the course for an invitation to the Sports
  Engineering 2021 team. The subject should be something like "You have been
  added as a guest to Delft University of Technology in Microsoft Teams".
- Click the "Open Microsoft Teams" link in the email and sign into MS Teams
  with your Microsoft account. You should see the "Sports Engineering 2021"
  team under "Teams" in the MS Teams application. You are done.

It is important to access the team the week before class and report any issues
to D.Boric@tudelft.nl for access help. We have had some connection issues
already.

If you are not registered for the course but would like to join the live
lectures, send an email to D.Boric@tudelft.nl with a request to be added. All
lectures will also be posted to Youtube by the end of June.
